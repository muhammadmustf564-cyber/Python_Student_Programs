Python practice programs: Counting student fails and filtering students

# Python Student Programs
This repository contains two beginner Python programs:

1. `fail_count_subjects.py` - Counts how many subjects each student has failed based on marks.
2. `students_above 2_fail.py` - Prints students who have more than 2 failed subjects.

These programs help practice loops, dictionaries, and conditional statements in Python.
